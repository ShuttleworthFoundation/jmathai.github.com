I remember telling Rachel when I left my job in May that I'd go no longer than 6 months without funding. Determined to close a round of funding by the end of 2012 I warmed up leads and had a spreadsheet of a couple dozen angel investors I knew by 1 or 2 degrees of separation. I probably still have that spreadsheet laying around; it'd be fun to dig up.

The Kickstarter funding wasn't a proper angel or seed round but I knew it would help. The exposure from Kickstarter helped get us accepted by Mozilla into their WebFWD accelerator. WebFWD didn't include any funding but legitimized us a little bit more and we got access to some great mentors and investors.

I met Marco Demiroz through WebFWD who acted as an unofficial advisor. Though he played the part, he wasn't able to take an advisor role since he was CEO of PlayFirst. Marco's one of those rare folks who was always available for a quick chat or reviewing a pitch deck over coffee. I owe many of our successes to his guidance during the early stages of our company.

## October through December

Between October and December we talked with numerous angel investors and pitched to Kapoor Ventures and Khosla Ventures. I knew the pitches weren't going well. If an investor is interested, you'll know. I knew anything else meant there wasn't chemistry.

When fundraising it's vital that you don't take rejection personally or as a sign that you won't get funding elsewhere. This is one of the most difficult parts of fundraising. I had prepared for maximum rejection and it was paying off; the rejection didn't phase me.

In December we finally launched the hosted version of OpenPhoto. Prior to the hosted version we were only releasing new versions of the open source software. The hosted service was the crux of our business model and we were excited to roll it out.

## March[ing] forward

2012 came to an end and I was faced with a decision and an unfulfilled promise I made to Rachel. I experienced something at that time which would be a recurring theme over the next 3 years; Rachel's unflinching support. Patrick and I were filled with optimism and passion. 

In February of 2012 we were invited to interview for the IO Ventures accelerator. Over 700 companies apply and they pick a few dozen to interview. I was optimistic about our chances but in March we got the email that we didn't make it in.
