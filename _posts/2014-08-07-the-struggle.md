There were many days and even weeks where I was convinced all this was a huge mistake. Ben Horrowitz, a well known venture capitalist, blogged on this topic in 2012 in blog post also called [The Struggle](http://www.bhorowitz.com/the_struggle).

## It's complicated

Us humans are neither binary or entirely logical; thank goodness. We're complex creatures and what constitutes happiness, contentment, joy or any of the opposite emotions depend on a large number of factors. This makes *The Struggle* even more acute.

## Something

The struggle started for me near the end of 2011 when we were failing from all angles to raise funding. I knew from the beginning that we absolutely needed to secure funding to succeed. I won't go into the details of our fundraising journey in this article but you can [read about it here](../fundraising/). The reason this was so difficult was multifold.

### No funding

There was a clear consequence of not raising funding; we'd have to abandon and shut down OpenPhoto. But there's a tougher reality that had dawned on me.

*Does shutting down mean failure? How would I explain this to friends and family who thought I was making a mistake 6 months ago? Do I just go back and get a normal job?*
